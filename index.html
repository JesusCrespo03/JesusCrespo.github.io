### CPSC 120

LAB 8

Lab 8 part 3 was my favorite because it works with animations, and I learned how to not only make them work but I learned how to pull them from other
files of code I enjoyed watching everything happen and creating the code that makes everything possilble to work.

LAB 6

Lab 6 part 2 I enjoyed playing with the guessing game making it to were player 1 can select what you have to guess and then the player 2
guesses what the answer is. I like this and messing with the (cin) and the (cout) to display the messages that we would ask the users.

LAB 7

I really enjoyed the math behind the Lab  part 1 when it came to the Julian Day. Using two actual dates and then doing the math
 that calculates the Julian day. Using the start months, dates, and year, doing all kinds of math towards the end month, date, and year.
